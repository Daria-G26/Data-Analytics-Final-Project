## Overview
This project analyzes well-being indicators across European countries, comparing cognitive life evaluation (Cantril ladder score) with emotional happiness.

This project uses two independent data sources:
1. Happiness and Life Satisfaction (Our World in Data, 2022) - Preparation performed in Power BI.
2. Insufficient Physical Activity (WHO, 2022) - Cleaned directly in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

The merged dataset serves as the foundation for all visual and statistical analyses.
The analysis includes data cleaning, visualizations, correlation, and interpretation of findings.
